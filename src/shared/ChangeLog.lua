			{
				"In the overworld (of World 1, for now, more coming soon), you can find soldiers wandering around with designated zones. Entering those zones will allow you and other players to fight those soldiers! You can attack these soldiers for Power similar to the training dummy, but they give much more. Soldiers will also attack back, and if you were attacking when they hit you, you'll be stunned for five seconds! Stop attacking with the correct timing, and you'll instead block their attack and possibly spawn a crit coin in their arena. Pick up the crit coin and your next attack against the soldier will be multiplied by five (including Power gain)! Finally, defeating a soldier in an overworld fight rewards some Gold, too.",

The cooldown time of a card is now shown in the bottom-left, and it is the number of rounds (card picks) that must elapse before the card is available again. The same restrictions apply to the NPC battlers, too.",
				"The three starting soldiers you automatically deploy will also follow cooldown rules.",

				`Ranged - has a ranged attack and deals slightly more damage to Light enemies.`,
