# Added
### Choose your cards!
- In battles, there is now a toggle for "auto play" which is on by default.
- When auto play is on, your cards will be chosen randomly as normal.
- When auto play is off, you can choose your own cards! As was always secretly happening under the hood, you'll get three to pick from. The others will be discarded and eventually reshuffled when necessary.
# Changed
- Prestige cost formula changed to have a much less drastic exponential cost. A linear cost has been added to keep it somewhat balanced.
- Tripled the power of all pets.
# Fixed
- The main quest no longer asks you to have significantly more gold than is required to progress to the next world.
