### Overworld fights!
- In the overworld (of World 1, for now, more coming soon), you can find soldiers wandering around with designated zones. Entering those zones will allow you and other players to fight those soldiers! You can attack these soldiers for Power similar to the training dummy, but they give much more. Soldiers will also attack back, and if you were attacking when they hit you, you'll be stunned for five seconds! Stop attacking with the correct timing, and you'll instead block their attack and possibly spawn a crit coin in their arena. Pick up the crit coin and your next attack against the soldier will be multiplied by five (including Power gain)! Finally, defeating a soldier in an overworld fight rewards some Gold, too.
### Card cooldown system
- Cards now have cooldowns! This means you can't play powerful cards over and over again without needing to mix it up. The cooldown time of a card is now shown in the bottom-left, and it is the number of rounds (card picks) that must elapse before the card is available again. The same restrictions apply to the NPC battlers, too.
- The three starting soldiers you automatically deploy will also follow cooldown rules.
- Some cards are no longer anywhere near as good because of long cooldowns, but they will be made more powerful in the future to adjust for this.
# Changed
- Several of the world maps have been changed from a linear format to a hub and spoke format, as well as some complete overhauls. More progress to come on this.
- Card, pet, and weapon shops as well as the pet merge machine all have labels, now.
# Fixed
- Performance improvements (hopefully) by not rendering worlds and battles you aren't in.
- Some various bugs I can't recall at this very moment.
