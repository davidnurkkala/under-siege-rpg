# Added
- Added damage numbers to battles!
- Added a WIP warning message. I am deeply sorry if you have invested a lot of time into the game before seeing this. I will consider giving some kind of reward to players who've shown a lot of dedication during this testing period.
### Tags
- Soldiers now have "tags!" Tags are adjectives that describe general aspects that soldiers can have. They affect how they interact with other soldiers. The current tags are as follows:
- 
- Light - deals extra damage to Armored enemies.
- Armored - takes significantly less damage from Ranged enemies.
- Ranged - has a ranged attack and deals slightly more damage to Light enemies.
- Evasive - has a chance to completely avoid damage from Ranged enemies.
- 
- Tags have been given to most of the soldiers in the game.
# Changed
- You now immediately teleport to a world when you buy it.
- A lot of balancing of numbers -- rebirths are cheaper and more incremental. Pets are a little weaker, worlds are a lot more expensive, and battles generally give more gold. Changes might be a little drastic but the assumption now is that you will rebirth a few times before reaching the final world.
- Reduced the range of all ranged soldiers by half (Mager, Hunter, and Elf Ranger).
# Fixed
- Fixed some typos.
- Fixed a bug that could rarely happen while picking cards in a battle which would cause your entire GUI to disappear.
- The power gain number in the Train button should now be accurate to any active boosts or VIP.
- VIP power gain now appropriately stacks multiplicatively.
