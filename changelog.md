# Added
- An update log menu on the left-hand side.
- A quest menu and quest tracker!
# Changed
- Made the game generally easier.
- The Bandit Rogue (hit-and-run bandit) now has a 50% slow when retreating.
- The addition of the quest menu has changed some quests, so you may have to recomplete them. This shouldn't be too bad, though, since you'll be able to get the rewards again!
- Made changes to the data safety lockout such that it more reliably lets you back in once your time is up.
# Removed
- The physical update log board that ruined *immersion* is now gone.
