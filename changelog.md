# Added
- Several non-unique enemy commanders such as the bandits will now actually chase you and force you in to combat if you get too close, and there are consequences for losing...
- Any NPC that you can fight will now have an escort of soldiers just like players do.
- Minor "filler" NPCs (as well as unfinished ones) standing around will now have sometimes-useful and otherwise flavorful one-line dialogues.
- The charcoaler NPC in Bilmen now offers to make you charcoal for materials and a fee. Charcoal can be used to make Steel.
# Changed
- Light soldiers now deal double damage to Armored soldiers rather than just 50% more.
- Ranged units now deal 150% damage to Light soldiers rather than 110%.
- Changed up some of the army compositions of enemies such as the bandits to largely make them easier.
# Fixed
- Last patch we published an incorrect version of the overworld which broke several quests and featured commanders you weren't suppoosed to be able to fight yet. This is now fixed.
